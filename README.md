# 🌐 Portfolio Website – Assignments 2

## 📖 Project Description
This personal portfolio website was developed as part of **Assignments 1–3** in the Web Engineering course.  
It demonstrates progressive enhancement across three stages — from basic structure to dynamic interactivity and client-side data persistence — using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  

The site presents my background, projects, and achievements in a **modern, responsive, and interactive design**, following accessibility and clean-code principles.
