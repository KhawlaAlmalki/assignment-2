# AI Usage Report

## Tools used & use cases
- **ChatGPT (GPT-5)**: Used to generate initial HTML/CSS/JS structures for the portfolio site, provide design inspiration (Apple-like themes), and suggest ways to implement features like dark mode, responsive layout, and scroll reveal animations.
- **WebStorm terminal**: Used to run Git commands, create folders/files, and link the repository to GitHub.
- **Placeholder image services (e.g., picsum.photos)**: Used for temporary project images until real screenshots are added.

## Benefits & challenges
**Benefits**
- Accelerated the development process: Instead of writing all HTML/CSS from scratch, I got a structured starting point.
- Learned clean coding patterns for responsiveness, accessibility, and dark mode handling.
- Gained inspiration for modern UI design (overlay hero section, gradients, minimal cards).

**Challenges**
- AI suggestions sometimes produced Linux-style commands (`mkdir -p`) that didn’t work in PowerShell. I had to adapt them.
- Some code was too advanced or verbose for assignment requirements, so I simplified it.
- Needed to double-check accessibility (contrast, aria-live for form feedback) and adapt icons when Font Awesome wasn’t allowed.

## Learning outcomes
- Understood how to structure a project folder (assets, docs, css, js).
- Learned how to integrate CSS design tokens, media queries, and prefers-color-scheme for auto dark mode.
- Practiced modifying generated code to ensure it matched both my personal style and assignment requirements.
- Strengthened my knowledge of Git workflow (init, add, commit, push, merge conflicts).

## How I modified AI suggestions responsibly
- I **did not copy blindly**; I reviewed every suggestion to ensure I understood it.
- When AI output was too complex, I **simplified the code** (e.g., merged CSS sections, reduced animations).
- I **rephrased and personalized content** (About Me, Projects, Achievements) so it reflected my actual experience.
- I made sure the final result was **original work**, using AI only as a learning assistant and accelerator.
